# 2. Requirements Analysis

> This section describes the domain and system requirements following a Domain-Driven Design approach.

## 2.1 Domain Definition

<!--
- Describe the problem domain
- Define the main goal of the system
- Identify the main actors involved
- Clarify what is inside and outside the domain boundary
-->

The Core Domain of the SmartGym Monitor system is Occupancy Tracking and Session Management.
It is responsible for maintaining consistent and real-time information about gym areas and machines, ensuring correct state transitions, enforcing capacity constraints, and managing usage sessions.
This domain contains the main business logic and represents the highest business value of the system.

The aim of the system is therefore to manage the gym comprehensively, with particular attention to the management of machine occupancy.
The system must be able to monitor the use of machines by users, providing real-time information on availability and occupancy.

We decide to split the domain in more subdomains as shown in the following section, in order to break down the complexity of the system.

## 2.2 Subdomains Definitions

- **Core — Occupancy Tracking & Session Management**: this subdomain represents the main business value of the system. It manages gym area occupancy, machine state transitions (Free / Occupied / Maintenance), and the lifecycle of gym and machine sessions. It enforces domain invariants such as capacity constraints and consistency between machine state and active sessions.

- **Supporting — Embedded**: this subdomain includes the interaction with physical devices. In particular, it manages machine sensors, RFID readers, turnstiles, and real-time communication with the backend.

- **Supporting — Area Management**: this subdomain manages all aspects related to gym areas. It handles area configuration, capacity definition, and tracking of entry and exit events.

- **Supporting — Machine Management**: this subdomain manages all aspects related to gym machines. It handles machine configuration, status updates, and integration with session tracking.

- **Generic — Analytics**: this subdomain provides data collection and processing functionalities. It offers machine occupancy rate, average dwell time, and attendance statistics to support administrative decision-making.

- **Generic — Authentication**: this subdomain manages identity verification and access control. It provides mechanisms for administrator login and microservice authentication.

## 2.8 Story Telling

> In this section, realistic usage scenarios are described in order to better understand how the SmartGym Monitor system behaves
> in real-life situations. Storytelling is used as a complementary technique to formal models and diagrams, allowing us to
> observe how domain concepts interact dynamically over time. <br> The objective of this section is to highlight how the system reacts to physical events (such as badge scans or machine usage detection),
> how sessions are created and terminated, and how data becomes available for monitoring and analytics.

### 2.8.1 Gym member Storytelling

<!--
- Describe system behavior from a gym member perspective
- Focus on interactions with sensors and physical space
-->

Users access the gym through the entrance turnstile, which reads their badge.
From the moment the user enters the gym, a gym session is tracked, which begins with entry and ends with exit from the gym.
Each time a user badge is scanned, it is logged, including the timestamp and, in the case of door access, the direction of travel.
Once inside the gym, users can go to the changing Area to get ready.
Every door in the facility, including the changing Area door, is equipped with an RFID reader that reads the user's badge to identify the Area they are entering.
Inside the equipment area, users can use the machines. Each machine tracks its use by a user, so it can detect whether a person is using it and for how long, in practice, it tracks user sessions.
There are also cardio and weight areas and an area for classes, where the machines detect their use by users in the same way as in the equipment area.
When the user has finished their workout, they return to the changing Area to get changed, passing through the doors and finally exiting the gym through the turnstile.

### 2.8.2 Administrator Storytelling

<!--
- Describe system behavior from an administrator perspective
- Focus on monitoring and decision-making activities
-->

The administrator logs into an Admin console via a web interface.
After authentication, they are shown a Dashboard displaying the current status of the gym, including the occupancy of each Area, individual machines, and even the operations available to the admin.
The admin can consult the occupancy history of the machines and gym attendance, in order to understand which days and times are of greatest interest to users.
The administrator can then view User Gym Sessions and User Machine Sessions in a convenient and understandable way, using appropriate graphs.

| Event                       | Trigger Condition                        | Effect in the Domain                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **GymSessionStarted**       | A badge is scanned at the gym entrance   | Creates a new _GymSession_ and marks the member as present in the gym.               |
| **GymSessionEnded**         | A badge is scanned at the gym exit       | Closes the active _GymSession_ for the corresponding badge.                          |
| **AreaEntered**             | A member enters a specific gym area      | Increments the `currentCount` of the corresponding _GymArea_.                        |
| **AreaExited**              | A member leaves a specific gym area      | Decrements the `currentCount` of the corresponding _GymArea_.                        |
| **MachineSessionStarted**   | A machine transitions to _Occupied_      | Creates a new _MachineSession_ and sets the machine status to _Occupied_.            |
| **MachineSessionEnded**     | A machine transitions to _Free_          | Closes the active _MachineSession_ and sets the machine status to _Free_.            |
| **MachineSetToMaintenance** | An administrator sets the machine status | Updates the machine status to _Maintenance_ and prevents new sessions from starting. |

## 2.10 Bounded Context

> Each bounded context defines its own **model, terminology, and invariants**, reducing coupling and enabling independent evolution of system components.

![BC_SmartGymMonitor](../public/resources/BC_SmartGymMonitor.png)

The SmartGym Monitor system is structured into **Core**, **Supporting**, and **Generic** bounded contexts as described below.

- **Occupancy Tracking & Session Management (Core)**:  
  This bounded context represents the central business logic of the system. It is responsible for tracking gym and machine sessions, maintaining real-time occupancy consistency, enforcing capacity constraints, and validating machine state transitions (_Free / Occupied / Maintenance_). It contains the highest business value and governs the main domain invariants.
- **Area Management (Supporting)**: This context manages gym areas and spatial configuration. It is responsible for area definitions, capacity limits, entry and exit event handling, and maintaining the number of people currently present in each area.
- **Machine Management (Supporting)**: This context focuses on gym machines and their lifecycle. It handles machine configuration, status updates, association with sessions, and synchronization with occupancy tracking.
- **Embedded (Supporting)**: This bounded context includes all interactions with physical or simulated devices. It manages RFID readers, turnstiles, door sensors, and proximity sensors, producing low-level events that are later translated into domain events.
- **Analytics (Generic)**: This context collects and processes historical data related to gym attendance, machine usage, and occupancy trends. It provides aggregated statistics and visual insights to support administrative decision-making and long-term planning.
- **Authentication (Generic)**: This bounded context manages identity verification and access control mechanisms. It handles administrator login, credential validation, and service-to-service authentication in the microservice architecture.

## 2.11 Context Map

The context map reflects a **hub-and-spoke** style integration centered on occupancy and session management.

- **Embedded → area-service / tracking-service / machine-service**: the embedded context acts as an event producer. It captures RFID scans, turnstile actions, and proximity changes, then forwards them to the backend via MQTT and HTTP adapters.
- **area-service ↔ tracking-service**: the area context consumes gym access information and contributes to occupancy consistency. It depends on the tracking service for the lifecycle of gym sessions.
- **machine-service ↔ tracking-service**: the machine context relies on session information to associate machine usage with a gym member and keep machine state synchronized with active sessions.
- **analytics-service ← area-service / tracking-service / machine-service**: the analytics context is a read-oriented consumer. It aggregates historical data generated by operational services and exposes monitoring views for administrators.
- **auth-service → gateway / dashboard**: the authentication context protects the administrative access path and issues JWT tokens consumed by the gateway and the Flask frontend.

The main integration patterns are:

- **Customer–Supplier** between embedded devices and operational services, because device events feed the core domain.
- **Open Host Service** for shared access through REST endpoints and the API Gateway.
- **Anti-Corruption Layer** in the embedded service, which translates low-level device messages into structured backend commands.

This structure allows each bounded context to evolve independently while preserving a consistent system-wide model.
